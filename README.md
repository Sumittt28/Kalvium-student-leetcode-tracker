# DSA Tracker

Automated LeetCode progress tracking for the Kalvium DSA mastery programme. Mentors
upload the student list once, post four problems a day, and press **Sync** — the
platform checks every student's submissions, scores them, and produces the daily
report, leaderboards and analytics on its own. **Email Reports** turns that daily
report into a mentor-approved email — who needs intervention today, and what to do
about it — see [docs/DAILY_EMAIL_REPORTING.md](docs/DAILY_EMAIL_REPORTING.md).

---

## The most important thing to know before you deploy this

**LeetCode has no official API for submission history, and the public endpoint returns
only the 20 most recent submissions per user.**

That is not an assumption — it was measured against the live endpoint while this was
being built. Requesting 100 results returned 20; requesting 500 also returned 20.

Three consequences shape the entire design, and you should understand them before
relying on the reports:

1. **Sync must run several times a day, not once.** A student who solves more than 20
   problems between two syncs will have submissions that we can never see. The default
   `SYNC_CRON` is every three hours for exactly this reason. Setting it to daily will
   silently lose data for your most active students.
2. **History cannot be backfilled.** Anything older than the 20-item window is
   unreachable. This is why every submission we ever observe is written to a permanent
   local mirror and never re-derived from the API — streaks, weekly and monthly reports
   all read from that mirror.
3. **Runtime and memory are not available.** The public queries expose submission id,
   title, slug, timestamp, status and language — nothing more. Those columns exist in
   the schema and are nullable; they are never populated with invented values.

If LeetCode changes or blocks this endpoint, the fix is confined to **one class**
(`apps/api/src/modules/providers/leetcode/leetcode.provider.ts`). Nothing else in the
codebase knows LeetCode exists.

## Quick start

### With Docker (recommended)

```bash
cp .env.example .env

# Generate real secrets — the API refuses to start in production with placeholders.
node -e "console.log('JWT_ACCESS_SECRET='+require('crypto').randomBytes(48).toString('base64url'))" >> .env
node -e "console.log('JWT_REFRESH_SECRET='+require('crypto').randomBytes(48).toString('base64url'))" >> .env

docker compose up -d
```

- Web client — <http://localhost:3000>
- API + Swagger — <http://localhost:4000/api/v1/docs>

Migrations run and the database seeds automatically on first boot. Sign in with
`SEED_ADMIN_EMAIL` / `SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD` from your `.env`, then **change the
password immediately**.

### Without Docker

Requires Node 20+ and a reachable PostgreSQL. Redis is optional — see
[Running without Redis](#running-without-redis).

```bash
npm install
npm run build:shared            # the domain package must be built first

# Point DATABASE_URL at your database
cp .env.example apps/api/.env   # then edit DATABASE_URL

npm run db:migrate -w @dsa/api  # or: npx prisma migrate dev
npm run db:seed -w @dsa/api

npm run db:seed:students        # optional: load the real roster (see below)

npm run dev                     # API on :4000, web on :3000
```

### Loading the real roster

`apps/api/prisma/roster.csv` holds the live cohort — one row per student, with the
columns the programme's spreadsheet already uses:

```
Full Name,Kalvium Email ID,Batch,Cohort,Max Belt Level,Squad,Leet code user name,Leet code profile link
```

`Batch` accepts a code (`A`, `B`) or a name (`Foundation`, `Intermediate`) and must name
a batch that already exists — the loader will not invent one from a typo. `Cohort` and
`Max Belt Level` are numbers; `Max Belt Level` is stored verbatim and is never derived
from score, solved counts or eligibility. The LeetCode columns are optional: a student
can be on the roster before their handle has been collected, and the sync skips them
until one is set rather than reporting a "user not found" that is not true.

> **`roster.csv` is gitignored and must stay that way.** It contains students' real
> names and email addresses, and this repository is public. `roster.example.csv` is the
> committed format reference — copy it to `roster.csv` and fill it in. When the file is
> absent the loader skips quietly, so a fresh clone and the deploy build both work
> without it.

The loader **synchronises** rather than merely inserting. Matching is on the normalised
email, so it is safe to re-run at any time:

| Roster says | Database says | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| present | missing | created |
| present | present | name, batch, cohort and belt updated in place |
| present | different batch | moved, and the change recorded in batch history |
| absent | present, with history | **archived** — hidden from every current view, every historical record kept |
| absent | present, no history at all | deleted |

Archiving is never deletion. A student who leaves the programme keeps their submissions,
daily results, streak history, leaderboard entries and email history; only their presence
in the current roster ends.

Update that file when the cohort changes and re-run the loader:

```bash
npm run db:seed:students -w @dsa/api -- --dry-run   # validate, write nothing
npm run db:seed:students -w @dsa/api               # apply
```

Students are matched on email, so re-running updates names, squads and handles in
place instead of creating duplicates. Squads are created inside `Batch 2026`
(override with `ROSTER_BATCH_NAME`), and the handle is derived from the profile link
when the username column is blank. Students who have dropped out of the sheet are
**reported, not deleted** — deleting one cascades away their whole submission mirror,
which LeetCode's 20-row window makes unrecoverable.

---

## Verifying the LeetCode integration

```bash
npm run smoke:provider -w @dsa/api
```

This hits the real endpoint and asserts the behaviour the system depends on — the
20-row cap, newest-first ordering, the incremental cursor, and that an unknown username
raises `USER_NOT_FOUND` rather than silently reading as "solved 0". Run it if the
numbers ever look wrong; it will tell you within seconds whether LeetCode changed
something.

## Deployment — a fully free stack ($0)

The app deploys across free tiers, with no paid infrastructure:

| Layer | Platform | Guide |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend (Next.js) | **Vercel** (Free) | [docs/DEPLOY_VERCEL.md](docs/DEPLOY_VERCEL.md) |
| Backend (NestJS) | **Render** Free Web Service | [docs/DEPLOY_RENDER_FREE.md](docs/DEPLOY_RENDER_FREE.md) |
| Database | **Neon** PostgreSQL (Free) | [docs/DEPLOY_NEON.md](docs/DEPLOY_NEON.md) |
| Scheduled sync / rollup | **GitHub Actions** → internal HTTP endpoints | `.github/workflows/` |
| Repo & CI | **GitHub** | — |

**How the schedule works without a paid cron:** a Free Web Service can be suspended when
idle, so the schedule lives in GitHub Actions. On cron, they `POST` to the backend's
internal endpoints — `/api/v1/internal/sync` (every 3h) and `/api/v1/internal/rollup`
(nightly) — authenticated with `Authorization: Bearer <CRON_SECRET>`. The in-process
scheduler is turned off in production (`SYNC_ENABLED=false`) so work never runs twice.

Deploy order: **Neon → Render (backend) → set `CORS_ORIGINS` → Vercel (frontend) → GitHub
Secrets**. Two build-time gotchas: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` is baked into the frontend at
build (redeploy Vercel if it changes), and **never set `PORT`** (Render injects it).

### Environment variables

| Variable | Where | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Backend | ✅ | Neon PostgreSQL connection string (pooled, `sslmode=require`). |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` | Frontend (Vercel) | ✅ | Backend base URL, e.g. `https://api.onrender.com/api/v1` (`/api/v1` is appended if omitted). Build-time. |
| `JWT_ACCESS_SECRET` | Backend | ✅ | ≥32 chars, random. Signs access tokens. |
| `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET` | Backend | ✅ | ≥32 chars, random, **different** from the access secret. |
| `CRON_SECRET` | Backend **and** GitHub | ✅ | Shared bearer secret for the internal cron endpoints. Must match. |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | Backend | ✅ | Comma-separated allowed origins, e.g. the Vercel URL. |
| `NODE_ENV` | Backend | ✅ | `production`. |
| `PORT` | Backend | ⛔ | **Do not set** — Render injects it; the app reads it. |
| `SYNC_ENABLED` | Backend | ✅ | `false` in production (GitHub Actions drive the schedule). |
| `QUEUE_DRIVER` | Backend | ✅ | `inline` (no Redis on the free stack). |
| `SEED_ADMIN_EMAIL` / `SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Backend | ✅ | First admin; change the password after first login. |
| `PROGRAM_TIMEZONE` | Backend | ✅ | e.g. `Asia/Kolkata`. All day boundaries resolve here. |
| `SWAGGER_ENABLED` | Backend | ➖ | `false` by default in production; `true` to expose `/api/v1/docs`. |
| `EMAIL_FROM` / `EMAIL_DEFAULT_TO` | Backend | ⚠️ | **Required for the nightly report to generate anything at all.** Without both, the Daily Report Generation workflow runs and produces nothing. `EMAIL_DEFAULT_TO` is comma-separated; `EMAIL_DEFAULT_CC` is optional. |
| `EMAIL_PROVIDER` / `EMAIL_API_KEY` | Backend | ➖ | Needed only to *send* an approved report. Without them reports are still generated and still wait for approval. See [docs/DAILY_EMAIL_REPORTING.md](docs/DAILY_EMAIL_REPORTING.md). |
| `SEED_STUDENT_PASSWORD` | Backend | ➖ | One shared initial password for newly provisioned student logins. Unset (default) gives each student their own random password. Must satisfy the password policy or the API refuses to boot. Safe only because an unchanged initial password can reach nothing but the change-password form. |

GitHub Actions secrets (Repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions): `BACKEND_URL`
(the Render base URL, no `/api/v1`) and `CRON_SECRET` (same value as the backend).

**Checking a deployment.** The *Production Smoke Test* workflow runs on every push to
`main` and can be run on demand. It waits for the pushed commit to actually be the one
serving traffic (a healthy `/health` only proves *a* version is up), asserts that the
endpoints holding student data refuse an anonymous caller, and then checks the invariants
reported by `GET /api/v1/internal/integrity` — students carrying a batch no report can see,
scored days naming an assignment that no longer exists, mentors with no campus grant, and
whether the nightly report is configured to produce anything. It reads production and
writes nothing.

Findings are split by severity. **Data** failures — stored records disagreeing with each
other, so students are being reported wrongly right now — fail the run. **Config** gaps —
a feature that cannot run until someone sets an environment variable — are printed and
annotated as warnings every run, but do not fail it. The split is deliberate: a config gap
nobody can fix today would leave the check permanently red, and a check that is always red
is one nobody reads, so the next real data regression would scroll past unnoticed.
See [.env.example](.env.example) for the complete local list.

Full detail, including the data-flow and the derived-state model, is in
[`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

### Two ideas that carry most of the weight

**Everything is derived from two stored facts.** The submission mirror and the
assignment list are the source of truth. Daily status, streaks, scores, leaderboards
and badges are all *caches* that `RollupService` can rebuild at any time. That is what
makes an admin-editable scoring formula safe: change the weights, press **Recalculate
scores**, and all of history is re-scored from stored data without contacting LeetCode
again.

**One place owns the calendar.** Every day boundary — "today", streak continuity,
completion time, weekly percentages — resolves through `ProgramTimeService` in a single
configured timezone (`PROGRAM_TIMEZONE`, default `Asia/Kolkata`). A submission at 23:50
IST belongs to a different day depending on whether you ask UTC or the server's locale,
and streak bugs from that are invisible until a mentor complains.

---

## Notable behaviours

### Every zero is explainable

At 250 students, misspelled usernames are a certainty. If those students simply showed
"Solved 0", mentors would read it as laziness. Instead each student carries a sync
status (`OK`, `USER_NOT_FOUND`, `PROFILE_PRIVATE`, `RATE_LIMITED`, `TIMEOUT`,
`PROVIDER_ERROR`), the "Solved 0" table shows the reason per row, and the dashboard
raises a banner counting students whose data could not be trusted this cycle.

### Import reports failures per row

A 250-row spreadsheet is never clean. The importer creates the valid rows and returns a
per-row error list — row number, field, and what was wrong — instead of failing the
whole upload with one 400. Batches and squads named in the sheet are created on demand,
and a pasted profile URL is accepted where a username was expected.

### Running without Redis

`QUEUE_DRIVER=inline` runs sync jobs in-process, and the cache falls back to an
in-memory LRU automatically if Redis is unreachable. This makes the platform fully
operable with Postgres alone.

The trade-off is stated plainly: inline jobs do not survive a restart and cannot spread
across replicas. Use `bullmq` (the default) for anything beyond a single instance.

---

## Scoring

Solving *n* of the day's problems scores `n × 25`, so the canonical table holds:
4 → 100, 3 → 75, 2 → 50, 1 → 25, 0 → 0. On top of that sit difficulty weighting,
tiered early-completion bonuses, a capped streak bonus, and weekly/monthly consistency
and perfect-period bonuses.

The formula is **data, not code** — stored as a `ScoringConfig` row, edited from the
admin panel, versioned, and read at compute time. Every score also carries a labelled
breakdown so a student can be told exactly why they scored what they did.

Leaderboards rank by score, then problems solved, then **earliest completion time**
(the specified tiebreaker), then streak, then consistency. Ties share a rank.
Squads are compared on averages, so a 12-person squad does not out-rank an 8-person one
on volume alone.

| `npm run build` | Build shared → API → web |
| `npm run typecheck` | Type-check all three packages |
| `npm test` | Unit tests |
| `npm run test:e2e -w @dsa/api` | Integration tests (needs `DATABASE_URL`) |
| `npm run db:migrate` | Apply migrations |
| `npm run db:seed` | Seed admin, scoring formula, demo cohort |

| `npm run db:studio` | Prisma Studio |
| `npm run smoke:provider -w @dsa/api` | Live LeetCode contract check |

## Security

JWT authentication implemented in-house rather than a hosted provider, so the stack
needs no external account and `docker compose up` is genuinely one command. Refresh
tokens are stored hashed and rotated on use; reuse of a revoked token revokes every
session for that user. Authentication is applied globally and opted out of per route,
so a newly added endpoint is protected by default. Also: role-based authorization with
implicit admin, Helmet, CORS allow-list, global and per-route rate limiting,
`whitelist`+`forbidNonWhitelisted` validation on every DTO, parameterised queries
throughout via Prisma, and an audit log of every mutating action.

**Before any real deployment:** set both JWT secrets, change the seeded admin password,
and set `CORS_ORIGINS` to your actual origin.

---

## Status

Verified on this machine: **153 unit tests pass** (130 domain — including the daily
email reporting rules — 23 provider/rate-limiter); shared/API/web all type-check;
shared/API/web all build, including the new `/email-reports` route (11 routes total);
the Prisma schema validates and every migration's SQL (including
`20260811000000_daily_email_reporting`) is generated and diff-verified against the
schema; the new GitHub Action YAML parses; the live provider smoke test passes all
8 checks against LeetCode.

**Not yet exercised against a live database.** No local PostgreSQL/Docker was available
in the environment this was built in, so the new migration has not been applied and the
API has not been booted end-to-end — the same gap the previous status note here
described. Run `npm run db:migrate -w @dsa/api && npm run db:seed -w @dsa/api` (or
`docker compose up`), then exercise the full flow once — generate a report for today,
yesterday, and an older date; record a blocker; preview, approve and send an email
(with `EMAIL_PROVIDER=resend` configured) — before relying on this in production.

See [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the data model and
[`docs/STATUS.md`](docs/STATUS.md) for a feature-by-feature completion breakdown.

Two features have their own documents because their design decisions are load-bearing and
easy to undo by accident:

* [`docs/CAMPUSES.md`](docs/CAMPUSES.md) — `Campus → Batch → Student`, audience resolution,
  the three leaderboard scopes, and how to onboard a campus roster safely.
* [`docs/BASELINE_TESTS.md`](docs/BASELINE_TESTS.md) — weekly independent-capability
  assessments, kept structurally apart from daily assignments, and the evidence-only
  review signals.
* [`docs/HISTORICAL_SYNC.md`](docs/HISTORICAL_SYNC.md) — the two-day lookback, what a sync
  recomputes, and how to backfill an assignment entered after its own date.
