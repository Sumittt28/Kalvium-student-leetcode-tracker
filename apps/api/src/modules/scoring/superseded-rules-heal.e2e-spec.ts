/**
 * The gap that let a wrong report go out while every health check stayed green.
 *
 * `20260911090000_assignment_solved_ever` redefined `solvedCount` from "solved inside the
 * lookback window" to "ever solved". The migration backfilled the *new* column losslessly
 * but could not raise `solvedCount` itself — that needs the submission mirror re-read per
 * day — and nothing scheduled the re-read. `findStaleAssignmentDays` looked only at
 * `assignments.updatedAt`, and no assignment had changed: only the rule had. So 229
 * production student-days went on publishing the old windowed figure, and the campus
 * report read them as though they were ever-solved figures.
 *
 * The fix is to make "computed under superseded rules" a state the rows themselves carry,
 * so the system can find and heal it without a human remembering a documented step. These
 * tests assert that end to end, on a real database, including the property the whole
 * design rests on: healing is idempotent, so the fifth run changes nothing.
 *
 * Fixtures live under a unique prefix and are removed in `afterAll`.
 *
 * Dates are in 2025 — before the programme existed (so no real data collides) and, just as
 * importantly, before the Coding Hours submission-window cut-over (`SUBMISSION_WINDOW_EFFECTIVE_DAY`).
 * These suites pin the rule that applies to assignments *before* that date: a solve at any
 * time counts, within a lookback for practice. The newer 16:00 -> 15:59 rule has its own suite
 * (`submission-window.e2e-spec.ts`); mixing the two here would test neither.
