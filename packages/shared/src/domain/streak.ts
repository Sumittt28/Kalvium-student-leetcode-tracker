/**
 * Streak computation.
 *
 * Three real-world rules shape this module and none is obvious from the spec:
 *
 * 1. **One problem is enough.** A day counts towards the DSA streak when the student
 *    solved *at least one* of that day's assigned problems. Requiring all four punished
 *    students who showed up and did partial work exactly as hard as students who did
 *    nothing, which is the opposite of what a streak is for. The threshold still comes
 *    from `ScoringConfig.streakQualification` so an admin can tighten it, but the
 *    shipped default is `AT_LEAST_ONE`.
 *
 * 2. **Days without an assignment are neutral.** If mentors skip a Sunday, nobody's
 *    streak should break. Streaks run over the sequence of *assigned* days, not the
 *    calendar — so consecutiveness means "adjacent assigned days", not "adjacent dates".
 *
 * 3. **Today is in progress until the day ends.** A student who has not yet solved
 *    today's problems at 10:00 has not broken their streak. The current streak is
 *    therefore measured from the most recent *concluded* day, with today counted only
 *    when it already qualifies.
 *
 * Whether a day qualifies is decided from `solvedCount`, which callers must derive with
 * `calculateAssignmentCompletion` — including its backwards lookback — so that a day
 * cleared by an early solve is not recorded as a break.
