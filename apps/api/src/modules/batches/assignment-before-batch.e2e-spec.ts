/**
 * The assignment published *before* the cohort was split into batches.
 *
 * The production incident, reproduced end to end against a real database:
 *
 *   Alliance published two batch-scoped assignments for **31 Aug** — one for Foundation,
 *   one for Intermediate. Its 46 students had no batch at all at that point. The next
 *   morning an admin divided them into the two batches. Every Mentor View figure for
 *   31 Aug then read zero: `assignedCount = 0`, no assignment linked, and the two batches
 *   merged into a single meaningless section.
 *
 * Nothing was wrong with the matching rules, the submissions or the assignments. The
 * placement rows were dated `effectiveFromDayKey = today`, so 31 Aug still resolved to
 * "no batch" for all 46 — and `selectAssignmentForScope` cannot pair a batch-targeted
 * assignment with a student who has no batch, by design. The cohort was scored against
 * nothing on a day they had genuinely been assigned work.
 *
 * The fix is in `BatchesService.defaultPlacementDay`: a student's *first* placement is
 * back-dated to enrolment, because classifying someone for the first time states what has
 * been true since they joined rather than changing anything today. A genuine move keeps
 * its "effective today" semantics, which is what stops an already-scored day being re-filed
 * under a batch the student was not in at the time (§7).
 *
 * What each test pins:
 *
 *  - the scenario itself, through the real `moveStudent` and `RollupService`;
 *  - that a *later* move does not drag closed days with it;
 *  - that submissions predating the split still count, and none are lost;
 *  - that the split does not leak one campus's assignment onto another's students.
 *
 * Fixtures live under a unique prefix and are removed in `afterAll`.
 *
 * Dates are in 2025 — before the programme existed (so no real data collides) and, just as
 * importantly, before the Coding Hours submission-window cut-over (`SUBMISSION_WINDOW_EFFECTIVE_DAY`).
 * These suites pin the rule that applies to assignments *before* that date: a solve at any
 * time counts, within a lookback for practice. The newer 16:00 -> 15:59 rule has its own suite
 * (`submission-window.e2e-spec.ts`); mixing the two here would test neither.
