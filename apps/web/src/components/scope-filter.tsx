/**
 * The global scope filter: `Campus [All] [Vels] [SRM]` + `Batch [All] [Foundation] …`
 *
 * One component, used on every page that can be narrowed, rather than a copy per page —
 * campuses and batches come from the API, so onboarding a third campus makes it appear
 * everywhere without touching a single page (§12).
 *
 * Two properties are worth being explicit about:
 *
 *  * **The batch control follows the campus.** Batches are campus-scoped, and both
 *    campuses have a "Foundation Level"; offering them side by side would give the user
 *    two identical-looking options that mean different things. With several campuses in
 *    view and none selected, the batch control therefore offers only "All" — an
 *    unnarrowed campus has no single batch list, and inventing one would be the
 *    ambiguity §8 rules out.
 *
 *    When exactly *one* campus is in view there is no ambiguity to protect against, and
 *    the batch list loads for it without the user having to select it. That case is a
 *    mentor with one campus grant, which is every mentor today: the campus control hides
 *    itself when there is nothing to choose between, so requiring a selection meant they
 *    could never make one, and every filtered page rendered with no filters at all.
 *
 *  * **The filter is a request parameter, never a client-side slice.** Every page passes
 *    the selection to the API; nothing here filters rows in the browser. That is what
 *    keeps one campus's numbers out of another campus's view, and what keeps the payload
 *    from growing with the roster (§12, §27).
 *
 * The selection is remembered in `sessionStorage` and shared through a context, so moving
 * from the dashboard to the leaderboard keeps the mentor in the campus they were already
 * looking at instead of silently resetting to "All". `sessionStorage` rather than
 * `localStorage` deliberately: a filter is working state for this sitting, not a durable
 * preference that should still be applied next week.
