/**
 * The reported scenario, reproduced through the real rollup against a real database.
 *
 *   Today is 11 September. Assignments for the 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th were shared with
 *   students directly at the time, and only entered into the tracker on the 11th. One
 *   student had solved Two Sum on the **5th** — before the assignment existed, and
 *   before the window any of those days would have searched.
 *
 *   For the 7 September assignment, Two Sum must read SOLVED.
 *
 * The previous behaviour failed this twice over. The submission query was bounded to
 * `[D-2, D]`, so a solve on the 5th was not even loaded for the 7th; and the day was
 * never recomputed at all unless a sync happened to touch it.
 *
 * These tests drive `RollupService.recomputeDay` rather than the pure rule, because the
 * pure rule was never the broken part — the load in front of it was, and a unit test of
 * the rule cannot see a row the query did not return.
 *
 * The other half of the requirement is asserted just as hard: crediting a June solve to a
 * September assignment must not manufacture a September streak. `solvedCount` and
 * `inWindowSolvedCount` are checked separately on every row.
 *
 * Fixtures live under a unique prefix and are removed in `afterAll`.
 *
 * Dates are in 2025 — before the programme existed (so no real data collides) and, just as
 * importantly, before the Coding Hours submission-window cut-over (`SUBMISSION_WINDOW_EFFECTIVE_DAY`).
 * These suites pin the rule that applies to assignments *before* that date: a solve at any
 * time counts, within a lookback for practice. The newer 16:00 -> 15:59 rule has its own suite
 * (`submission-window.e2e-spec.ts`); mixing the two here would test neither.
