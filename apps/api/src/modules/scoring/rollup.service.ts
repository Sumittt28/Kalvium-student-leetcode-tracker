   *    nothing" to "solved everything" changes what the 8th and 9th say. Leaving them
   *    would trade one visibly-wrong number for several quietly-wrong ones.

  /**
   * Days whose stored results no longer reflect the assignment they should be scored
   * against — the set a sync has to recompute beyond its own day.
   *
   * The invariant is deliberately general rather than a special case for late-added
   * assignments: **a day is stale when its assignment has been written more recently than
   * the day was last computed.** One condition covers every way a day can go out of date:
   *
   *  * the assignment was *added* after its own date (the reported bug — an assignment
   *    dated 20 Aug inserted on 22 Aug was never evaluated, because nothing recomputed
   *    20 Aug afterwards);
   *  * its problem list was edited;
   *  * its audience was retargeted;
   *  * the day was never computed at all, so there is no `computedAt` to compare against.
   *
   * It is also self-clearing: one recompute moves `computedAt` past `updatedAt` and the
   * day stops being reported, so a sync does not keep redoing settled work.
   *
   * The second query covers the one case the first structurally cannot: a **deleted**
   * assignment. `DailyStatus.assignmentId` is `SetNull`, so deleting an assignment leaves
   * rows that still claim `assignedCount = 4` while naming no assignment — 15 students
   * recorded as having missed four problems on a day that has no assignment at all. That
   * is a false zero on the report, the leaderboard and the streak. A query that starts
   * `FROM assignments` can never find those days, because the row it would have to find
   * them by is the one that was deleted. So they are found from the wreckage instead: a
   * scored day naming no assignment while claiming problems were assigned is, by
   * construction, a day whose assignment went away after it was computed — the rollup only
   * ever writes a non-zero `assignedCount` from an assignment it had in hand.
   *
   * Also self-clearing: the recompute finds no assignment, writes `assignedCount = 0`, and
   * the day stops matching.
   *
   * The third query covers the case neither of the others can see: the **rules** changed
   * while the data did not. When `solvedCount` was redefined from "solved in the window"
   * to "ever solved", every historical row was left holding the old figure — and was
   * invisible to the first query, because no assignment had been touched. That is the
   * shape of the reported bug: an assignment entered on the 11th for the 7th, whose
   * students had solved the problems on the 5th, going on reporting zero. Rows stamped
   * with a superseded `computedVersion` are stale by definition, so the ordinary
   * recompute path now heals a rule change without anyone remembering to ask it to.
   *
   * Self-clearing in the same way: the recompute stamps the current version and the day
   * stops matching, which is what makes running this five times produce one change and
   * four no-ops.
   *
   * `assignment.createdAt` is never used to filter *submissions* — that would discard
   * genuine work done before the assignment was entered, which is the very thing the
   * lookback window exists to allow. It is only ever used here, to decide *which days to
   * recompute*.
