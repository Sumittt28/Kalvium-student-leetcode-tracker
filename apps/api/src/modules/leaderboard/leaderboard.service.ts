/**
 * Leaderboards at three scopes: global, campus, and campus + batch.
 *
 * The three are different orderings of the same underlying scores, and the distinction
 * matters enough to be worth stating (§14, §26):
 *
 *  * **Global** ranks every active student across every campus, from `globalRank`, which
 *    the rollup computes over the whole population. It is never assembled by merging or
 *    interleaving per-campus boards — that produces a different, wrong ordering.
 *  * **Campus** ranks within one campus, from the `rank` column the rollup computes per
 *    campus. A student's global standing travels with every row regardless, so narrowing
 *    to a campus never makes someone's overall position disappear.
 *  * **Campus + batch** is re-numbered in memory from the campus's snapshot rows, using
 *    the same `rankEntries` tie rules. Storing a third materialised rank would mean
 *    recomputing it on every batch move for no benefit at these sizes.
 *
 * **Students with no batch are included**, in the global and campus boards alike. That is
 * the existing rule rather than a new one: a `LeaderboardEntry` is written for every
 * active student the rollup scores, and scoring has never required a batch. A student
 * awaiting their diagnostic assessment can still solve problems, and excluding them would
 * make the "global" board quietly not global. They simply have no batch-scoped board to
 * appear in until one is assigned, and rank wherever their score puts them.
