# Historical assignments and backfill

What happens when an assignment is entered *after* the date it applies to — and why the
sync has to do more than recompute today.

> **From 12 Oct 2026 this no longer applies to new assignments.** Coding Hours assignments dated
> on or after that day count only submissions made from 16:00 on the assignment day to 15:59 the
> next day — see [SUBMISSION_WINDOW.md](SUBMISSION_WINDOW.md). The rule below still governs every
> earlier assignment and is unchanged for them.

## The rule (assignments before 12 Oct 2026)

**An assigned problem the student has solved at any time counts as solved.** No date
filter applies to that judgement — not the assignment's day, not a lookback window, and
emphatically not `assignment.createdAt`. An assignment dated 7 Sep, entered into the
tracker on the 11th, credits a student who solved its problems on the 5th, in June, or
after the assignment day has passed. The assignment *date* decides which day a question
belongs to; the student's LeetCode history decides whether it is solved.

The dated window still exists, separated rather than removed. Every figure whose name
starts `inWindow` is measured over **D-2 … D** inclusive in program time
(`Asia/Kolkata`), and answers the other question: did the student do this work around the
day it was set.

| | Question | Time filter | Read by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `solvedCount` | Can this student solve the assigned problems? | **none** | dashboard, reports, analytics, the mentor tracker, completion % |
| `inWindowSolvedCount` | Did they work on them that week? | `[D-2, D]` | streaks, the daily score |

Both sit on `DailyStatus`, neither is derivable from the other, and a database `CHECK`
(`daily_statuses_in_window_not_above_solved`) keeps the window count from exceeding the
total. Collapsing them is what made a cohort read 0/4 on problems many had solved; keeping
only the first would manufacture a September streak out of a June solve, which is the same
error pointing the other way.

The window is a half-open UTC interval derived from program-local midnights, so a
submission at `2026-08-20 23:30 IST` (= `18:00 UTC`) belongs to 20 Aug and cannot drift
into the 21st.

### Where this is enforced

`calculateAssignmentCompletion` in `@dsa/shared` is the rule. The part that was actually
broken, though, was upstream of it: `RollupService.evaluateDay` and
`StudentMetricsService` both bounded the **submission query** to the window before the
rule ever saw the rows. No amount of correctness in a pure function can recover a
submission that was never loaded, which is why the fix is a query change and the
regression test drives the rollup rather than the rule.

## The bug this documents

An assignment dated **2026-08-20** was entered on **2026-08-22**. Foundation students had
already solved the problems. Running Sync reported every one of them as having solved
nothing.

The completion rules were correct the whole time. The failure was upstream of them: a sync
recomputed `job.dayKey ?? today` and nothing else, so a day whose assignment appeared
afterwards was simply never re-evaluated. Nothing ever asked the rules about 20 Aug.

## What a sync recomputes now

Three sources, unioned, bounded to 14 days before the job day and never past it:

1. **The job's own day** — always, so a sync stays a reliable way to refresh today.
2. **Days reachable from newly-mirrored submissions.** A submission on 18 Aug can satisfy
   an assignment dated 18, 19 or 20 Aug (`assignmentDaysAffectedBy` — the inverse of the
   lookback). Recomputing only the day the submission landed on leaves the others wrong.
3. **Days whose assignment is newer than their last computation.** One condition covers
   every way a day goes stale: the assignment was added late, its problems were edited, its
   audience was retargeted, or the day was never computed at all. Detected from stored
   state rather than from what a particular sync happened to fetch, so it works even when
   no new submission arrives. It self-clears — one recompute moves `computedAt` past
   `updatedAt` and the day stops being reported.

Days are recomputed oldest-first, because each day's streak reads the one before it.

## Entering an assignment for a past date

Nothing further is required: `AssignmentsService.create` and `update` call
`RollupService.reconcileAssignmentDay`, which recomputes that date — and the days after
it, because a corrected day changes what every later day's streak reads — before the
request returns. It reads only the submission mirror, makes no provider calls, and is
idempotent.

Ranges longer than 30 days are refused inline rather than run to a timeout; use
`POST /admin/recompute`, which runs in the background.

## Backfilling a specific date manually

If a day needs correcting without touching its assignment:

```
POST /sync/backfill { "dayKey": "2026-08-20" }
```

It resolves that date's assignments, their campus + batch audiences, the eligible students
and the submissions already in the mirror, then rewrites that day's results. It makes no
LeetCode calls, so it cannot create, move or overwrite a submission, and it is safe to run
repeatedly.

It recomputes **from that day through today**. Days *before* it are untouched. Days after
it are not bystanders — `streakAtDay` on 21 Aug is a function of what 20 Aug says — so
leaving them would trade one visibly-wrong number for two quietly-wrong ones.

For a wider correction, `POST /admin/recompute { from, to }` takes an explicit range.

## Audience is never widened by a recompute

Recomputing more days must not credit more students. The audience of an assignment is
`Campus + Batch + Date`, resolved per student against the campus and batch they were in
**on that day** — so an SRM Foundation student who solved Vels Foundation's problems on the
same date scores nothing against their own assignment.

A database `CHECK` constraint (`assignments_batch_implies_campus`) makes the one dangerous
shape impossible: a non-null batch with a null campus would read as "this batch, at every
campus" and hand one campus's problems to another's students. The services already reject
it; the constraint is the backstop for seeds, migrations and psql sessions.

## Performance

The only per-sync addition is one indexed query for stale days
(`daily_statuses_dayKey_computedAt_idx`, index-only, one row per day). Recomputation reuses
the submission mirror and issues no provider calls, so a backfill of a three-day range
completes in well under a second at current roster size.
