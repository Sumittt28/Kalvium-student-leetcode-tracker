/**
 * The late-added historical assignment, verified end to end against a real database.
 *
 * The production scenario this exists for:
 *
 *   An assignment dated **2026-08-20** was entered on **2026-08-22**. Foundation students
 *   had already solved the problems on the 18th, 19th and 20th. Running Sync reported
 *   every one of them as having solved nothing.
 *
 * The cause was not the matching rules — those were already right — but the *day
 * selection*: a sync recomputed only `job.dayKey ?? today`, so a day whose assignment
 * appeared afterwards was never re-evaluated. These tests pin both halves: that the
 * completion rules handle a late assignment, and that the pipeline actually reaches the
 * day at all.
 *
 * They also cover the campus/batch audience matrix, because "recompute more days" must
 * not become "credit more students": a Vels Foundation assignment stays Vels Foundation's
 * even when SRM students solved the identical problems on the identical day.
 *
 * Fixtures live under a unique prefix and are removed in `afterAll`, so this is safe to
 * run against a development database.
 *
 * Dates are in 2025 — before the programme existed (so no real data collides) and, just as
 * importantly, before the Coding Hours submission-window cut-over (`SUBMISSION_WINDOW_EFFECTIVE_DAY`).
 * These suites pin the rule that applies to assignments *before* that date: a solve at any
 * time counts, within a lookback for practice. The newer 16:00 -> 15:59 rule has its own suite
 * (`submission-window.e2e-spec.ts`); mixing the two here would test neither.
