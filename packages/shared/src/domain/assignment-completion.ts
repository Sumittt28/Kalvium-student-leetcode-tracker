/**
 * Assignment completion — the one definition of "did this student solve the day's work".
 *
 * Everything downstream (daily status, streaks, buckets, leaderboards, the email report,
 * the student profile) is derived from this module, so those surfaces can never disagree
 * with one another about a student's day.
 *
 * Three rules encode the business requirement, and each exists because the naive
 * alternative produced wrong numbers in production:
 *
 * 1. **Solved is solved, whenever it happened.** An assignment dated D asks whether the
 *    student can solve its problems; a submission's timestamp is evidence of that
 *    ability, never a condition on it. So the per-problem outcome this module reports
 *    carries **no time filter at all** — not the assignment day, not the lookback, and
 *    emphatically not `assignment.createdAt`. A problem accepted on 5 Sep counts for the
 *    7 Sep assignment that was entered into the tracker on the 11th.
 *
 *    The dated window has not gone away, it has been *separated*: every figure whose
 *    name starts `inWindow` answers the second question — did the student do this work
 *    around the day it was set — over `[D - LOOKBACK_DAYS, D]`. Streaks and the daily
 *    score read those, because solving Two Sum in June cannot make September a day the
 *    student practised. Both numbers sit on the same row and neither is derivable from
 *    the other; collapsing them is what made an entire cohort read 0/4 on problems they
 *    had solved.
 *
 * 2. **Problem identity, not title.** Titles get re-worded and differ in punctuation and
 *    case between the assignment record and the submission mirror. Matching is done on
 *    the stable identifiers — the tracked problem id where we have one, otherwise the
 *    LeetCode `titleSlug`, which is what the provider itself keys submissions by.
 *
 * 3. **Distinct, accepted problems only.** A problem counts once no matter how many
 *    times it was submitted, and only an `ACCEPTED` verdict counts. Anything else
 *    (Wrong Answer, TLE, runtime/compile error, still pending) is an attempt, not a
 *    completion.
 *
 * The functions here are pure: callers resolve the submission window from the database
 * and pass the rows in. Day arithmetic is in program-local time (`Asia/Kolkata`) via
 * `./time`, never UTC calendar days — see `assignmentWindow`.

 * This is the documented allowance for assignments published late; it is deliberately
 * not configurable per-assignment, because a report has to be comparable across days.

/**
 * The version of the completion *rules* that produced a stored result.
 *
 * `computedAt` answers "when was this row written"; it cannot answer "was it written by
 * the rules we run today". Those are different questions, and conflating them is what
 * left 229 production student-days reporting a windowed `solvedCount` for eight days
 * after the ever-solved rule shipped: the rows were recent, their assignments had not
 * changed, so nothing marked them stale and no recompute was scheduled. The gap needed a
 * human to remember a documented post-deploy step, and the report went out before anyone
 * did.
 *
 * Stamping the version onto every row closes that by construction. A row computed under
 * an older version is stale by definition, `findStaleAssignmentDays` reports it, and the
 * ordinary recompute path heals it — no migration can backfill a rule change, but it does
 * not have to, because the system now knows it is owed one.
 *
 * Bump this in the same commit as any change to what `calculateAssignmentCompletion`
 * returns. Do not bump it for refactors that cannot change a stored figure.
 *
 * History:
 *  * `1` — original: `solvedCount` measured over the lookback window only.
 *  * `2` — ever-solved `solvedCount`, windowed figures separated into `inWindow*`.
 *
 * The 16:00 -> 15:59 submission window (`submission-window.ts`) is **not** a version bump,
 * on purpose. It applies by *assignment date* — from `SUBMISSION_WINDOW_EFFECTIVE_DAY` on —
 * and can change nothing already stored: no row for an earlier day is affected, and no row
 * for a later day exists yet. Bumping would flag every stored day stale and re-derive tens
 * of thousands of rows to the same values. If that date is ever moved *earlier*, rows
 * between the old and new date do change, and that is the moment to bump.
