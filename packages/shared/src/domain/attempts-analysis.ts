/**
 * Coding-Hours Attempts Analysis — "this student tried an assigned problem N times and
 * still has no accepted solution", and "this student needed more than one try".
 *
 * The unit is one student x one assigned problem x one assignment day, and the evidence
 * is the submission mirror, never `DailyProblemStatus.attempts` (which is ever-based and
 * would count a June attempt against a September assignment). Four rules:
 *
 * 1. **The assignment period starts on the assignment day D and runs until the same
 *    problem is next assigned to the same student** (exclusive), or indefinitely if it
 *    never is. Submissions before D are not attempts at the assignment. Submissions after
 *    D are: the first version of this feature stopped the period at D itself, which
 *    turned every student who worked on the problem a day later into "0 attempts" — 773
 *    of the 1,798 mirrored submissions to assigned problems on the 23 Sep production
 *    snapshot fell after their assignment day. Ending the period at the next assignment of
 *    the same problem keeps the periods disjoint, so no submission is ever counted against
 *    two assignments.
 *
 * 2. **One LeetCode submission is one attempt.** Rows are de-duplicated on the provider's
 *    submission id before anything is counted.
 *
 * 3. **Failed attempts stop at the first accepted.** Unsolved: every attempt failed.
 *    Solved: only the non-accepted submissions *before* the first accepted count.
 *
 * 4. **No evidence is not a zero.** A pair with no submission in the period is only "Not
 *    Attempted" when the student's LeetCode data is readable. If it is not (no handle, a
 *    profile LeetCode says does not exist, a failing sync) the pair is `NO_DATA`. A pair
 *    whose problem was accepted *before* the period is `SOLVED_BEFORE_ASSIGNMENT` — the
 *    ever-solved Campus Analysis counts it as solved, and calling it "Not Attempted" here
 *    would contradict that screen.
