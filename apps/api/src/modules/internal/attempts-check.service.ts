/**
 * Production cross-check for Attempts Analysis, for the smoke test.
 *
 * Runs the real `CampusAttemptsService` (what the page, drill-down and exports serve) and
 * an independent SQL implementation of the same rules — assignment period from the
 * assignment day until the same problem is next assigned to the student, submissions
 * de-duplicated by the mirror's own unique key, failed attempts stopping at the first
 * accepted — against the live database, and reports whether they agree.
 *
 * Aggregates only. This repository and its workflow logs are public, so nothing here
 * names a student or a LeetCode handle; a single student can be checked by id.
