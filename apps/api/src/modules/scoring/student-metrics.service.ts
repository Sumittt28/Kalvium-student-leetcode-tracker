/**
 * The three student metrics that the rest of the app must not compute for itself.
 *
 * Every surface — dashboard, daily/email reports, student details, leaderboards,
 * analytics — reads these, so they cannot drift apart the way they did when each
 * controller derived its own numbers. The rules themselves are pure functions in
 * `@dsa/shared`; this service only supplies the database reads.
 *
 * The three are deliberately separate quantities and must never be substituted for one
 * another:
 *
 *  - `calculateStudentLeetcodeTotalSolved` — lifetime distinct LeetCode problems solved.
 *  - `calculateAssignmentCompletion`       — assigned problems cleared for one day (X/Y).
 *  - `calculateStudentDsaStreak`           — consecutive assignment days with ≥1 solved.
 *
 * Batch variants exist for every one of them because the cohort is ~250 students: a
 * per-student query inside a loop is the difference between one report and 250 of them.

   *    as fresh as the last profile refresh.
   *

   * still credited for it. Neither source can make the number go down spuriously.
